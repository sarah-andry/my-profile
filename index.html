 			I'm a first-year student at Iéseg School of Management, which is located in La Défense. I have already discovered new subjects in the field of economics that have always attracted me. I have learned many different skills, such as teamwork and the use of Word and Excel software. Indeed, I can't wait to discover new things and meet new people.

        	<h2>Personnal experience</h2>
 		  <p>
 			I have done an internship at the famous company Suez, which is located at La Défense. Thanks to this, I have understood how a company works, and I have learned a lot of skills. I have met many employees with different positions in the company. I'm also part of a babysitting agency for 2 years now. Indeed, I used to babysit kids from 2 to 12 years old.

        	<h2>Volunteer</h2>
 		<p>
 		   I had the opportunity to help and feed homeless people during the winter with the association Resto du Coeur. So that, thanks to our commitment, many people were able to eat in this cold period.

 	   	    <h2>Travels</h2>
 		<p>
 			Traveling is my passion. Of course, I love discovering the world and places where the cultures are very different from France. It is a way to open my mind and learn more about others way of life. Since I'm young, I have traveled a lot with my family and my friends all over the world. Thanks to this, I have created many amazing memories.

	    	<h2>Sports</h2>
 		<p>
 			Sport is very important for me. I've done classic dance since I was 5 years old. I taught me discipline but also how to manage stress for the gala, for example. I also play tennis for 4 years now. This is a way for me to decompress, unwind, and work my cardio.
